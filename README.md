# SET UP


## Things to consider:
   .. This App is cloud based application and I have used Firebase for the Authentication and for the content storage so for the setup you have to create your own project on the firebase.
   .. As for the AI you have to create your account on the AI studio and from there you have to access your AI model API and then you can add that API in the project in the
      GeminiAIIntegration.kt file
