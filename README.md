   ### 🔎 Setup of the App is in the below of the readme file so make sure to read all the file for fully implementation of the App in Android Studio, Youtube video also attached below 
   ### for the easiness.

## Dependency on third party:

   ⭕ Firebase Authentication
   
   ⭕ Firestore
   
   ⭕ Gemini AI API
   
   


## Intro:
  Slore is an Android App built with **Kotlin and jetpack compose** (UI Kit) it is a cloud based application which stores Passwords, Emails, Notes and your Thoughts (currently) category 
  based, and the user can access his documents from the seperate section. I am using the LASTPASS and the NOTES taking apps and I have found that I have to use different apps to the do  
  multitasking so I have thought that why not to make my own app which uses the modern day technology including AI integration.

### Feature 1️⃣:
Another special feature is the integration of the **AI** in every page when a user will click that icon in the App then a built in AI will pop up and the user can ask his any query he do
not have to go outside of the App.

# SET UP


## Things to consider:
   .. This App is cloud based application and I have used Firebase for the Authentication and for the content storage so for the setup you have to create your own project on the firebase.
   .. As for the AI you have to create your account on the AI studio and from there you have to access your AI model API and then you can add that API in the project in the
      GeminiAIIntegration.kt file

### the below are the website 

      https://ai.google.dev/aistudio
      https://firebase.google.com/


◽ so lets start 👇

◼ You can even download the zip file from the github main code page or if you have git then just copy the link and then paste it in the git and clone the repository.

◼ I have used Firebase Authentication and Firestore(for database), go to the above following link  (https://firebase.google.com/) and make the new project in Firebase and make sure to add the SHS1 code in the firebase from the Android Studio (all the dependencies are already added to the project although you can update all the dependencies version on yourself for the better performance)
